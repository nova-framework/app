## What is the Nova Framework?

Nova Framework is a PHP 7.1 MVC system. It's designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing developers to build better and easy to maintain code with PHP.

The base framework comes with a range of [helper classes](https://github.com/nova-framework/framework/tree/master/system/Helpers).

## Requirements

**The framework requirements are limited.**

- PHP 7.1 or greater.
- Apache Web Server or equivalent with mod rewrite support.
- IIS with URL Rewrite module installed - [http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)

**The following PHP extensions should be enabled:**

- Fileinfo (edit php.ini and uncomment php_fileinfo.dll or use php selector within cpanel if available.)
- OpenSSL
- INTL
- MBString

> **Note:** Although a database is not required, if a database is to be used, the system is designed to work with a MySQL database using PDO.

## Installation

This framework was designed and is **strongly recommended** to be installed above the document root directory, with it pointing to the `public` folder.

Additionally, installing in a sub-directory, on a production server, will introduce severe security issues. If there is no choice still place the framework files above the document root and have only index.php and .htacess from the public folder in the sub folder and adjust the paths accordingly.

#### Recommended
The framework is located on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/nova-framework/app).

You can install the framework from a terminal by using:

```
composer create-project nova-framework/framework foldername 4.* -s dev
```
The foldername is the desired folder to be created.


> **Note:** You can install the bare application variant from a terminal by using:

```
composer create-project nova-framework/app foldername 4.* -s dev
```

> **Note:** For additional installation instructions, for example; setting up a Virtualhost (Recommended for Local Development), Nginx or IIS with URL Rewrite, [please visit the install docs](http://novaframework.com/documentation/v3/install).
